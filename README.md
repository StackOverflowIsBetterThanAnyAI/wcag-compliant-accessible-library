<h1>WCAG-compliant-accessible-library</h1>

<h2>I need your help</h2>

I'm currently writing my <strong>bachelor's thesis</strong>.

I am focussing on digital accessibility on the internet.

In order to improve digital accessibility, I have created this TypeScript React component library as part of this work.

In order to be able to analyse this library <strong>scientifically</strong>, I need <strong>your feedback</strong>!

If you have tested this library - even if it is <strong>only one</strong> component - please answer a few questions about it.

<a href="https://www.survio.com/survey/d/E3R7X9M7V8N9E9V9W" target="_blank">The survey</a> will take about <strong>5 to 10 minutes</strong>.

Thank you very much.

Kind regards, Michael

<h2>What is it about?</h2>

This library deals with the WCAG 2.2 success criteria.

WCAG stands for Web Consortium Accessibility Guidelines and is an initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium.

The aim behind these guidelines is to make the internet accessible to a wider audience.

The WCAG 2 guidelines are primarily aimed at people with disabilities, people with impaired vision and hearing, impaired movement, speech impairments, photosensitivity and cognitive impairments.

However, people without these disabilities will also benefit from these guidelines.

These guidelines apply to web content for desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile devices.

WCAG 2.2 is divided into four chapters:

1) Perceivable,

2) Operable,

3) Understandable and

4) Robust.

For each of these four principles, the W3C provides a set of success criteria that should be met to ensure digital accessibility.

<h2>Content</h2>

This library takes up two of these four principles: 1) Perceivable and 3) Understandable.

The success criteria covered in this library are:

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>,

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>,

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html">1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose</a>,

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-parts.html">3.1.2 Language of Parts</a> and

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input.html">3.2.2 On Input</a>

Each of these success criteria is given certain techniques by the W3C which fulfil these criteria.

These defined techniques and components have been implemented in this library:
